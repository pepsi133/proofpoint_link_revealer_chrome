Main purpose of this fork is being able to fully control the code - due to my personal/work reasons. I am not planning to use it for any gains or purely work reasons.
I am just not including any extensions to chrome, which I am not able to verify source code in 100%.

It is possible i will be adjusting some look&feel of this extension or limiting the domains it works on. Nothing more.
Once I find a way to contact original author I will request approval for above use of this code.

DESCRIPTION: Show URLs when you hover over links into a webpage.

HOW DOES IT WORK:
This extension will show up the url of the link you're going to click.

You are probably asking yourself why this extenions was made for...well this,
believe it or not, were made because modern browsers like Google Chrome are
going to hide at the most the status bar of the url you're going to click.
So i hope with this that you're going to know more where are you going to
surf to, with some nice SEO tools that i'm sure you will appreciate.
